# Aerolab Challenge

Frontend challenge taken from [Goncy's Github](https://github.com/goncy) 

The company Aerolab used to take it as a technical test.  
It's a marketplace where they can redeem points for products.  
Built with React + Next.js.  

This is a local version, to avoid hitting the API without permission.
